# LinuxWizards

A collection of powerful Bash scripts to automate the setup and configuration of a developer-friendly Linux environment.

## Features

- **Software Wizard:** Installs essential development software, including browsers, editors, and containerization tools.
- **Git Wizard:** Automates Git configuration and SSH key generation for seamless version control.
- **Alias Wizard:** Sets up a comprehensive list of shell aliases to boost productivity in the terminal.

## Prerequisites

- Debian or a Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Linux Mint).
- `sudo` or root privileges.
- An active internet connection.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ferdotdeb/LinuxWizards.git
    cd LinuxWizards
    ```

    **1.1. Or download the scripts individually:**

    Use `curl` to download the scripts you need. Note that `common_functions.sh` is required by the other scripts.

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ferdotdeb/LinuxWizards/main/common_functions.sh
    ```

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ferdotdeb/LinuxWizards/main/softwareWizard.sh
    ```

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ferdotdeb/LinuxWizards/main/gitWizard.sh
    ```

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ferdotdeb/LinuxWizards/main/aliasWizard.sh
    ```

2. **Grant execution permissions:**

    You need to make the scripts executable. You can do this with the following command:

    ```bash
    chmod +x scriptName.sh
    ```

3. **Run the desired script:**

    Execute the script you need. In general, the command is:

    ```bash
    ./scriptName.sh
    ```

## Scripts Breakdown

### `softwareWizard.sh`

This script automates the installation of essential software for developers. It handles `apt` packages and third-party applications like Google Chrome, Visual Studio Code, and Docker.

### `gitWizard.sh`

This script streamlines your Git setup. It configures your global Git credentials (username and email) and generates an ED25519 SSH key pair for secure authentication with platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

### `aliasWizard.sh`

This script enhances your terminal productivity by automatically setting up a comprehensive list of useful aliases. It creates or uses the existing `.bash_aliases` file in your home directory and populates it with carefully curated aliases to streamline common development tasks. The script checks for duplicate entries before adding new aliases, ensuring a clean configuration.

### `common_functions.sh`

This is a utility script and should not be executed directly. It provides shared functions for displaying colored status messages (success, error, warning), making the output of the main scripts more readable and user-friendly.
